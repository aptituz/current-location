current-location - simple tool for location-dependent configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple tool for location-dependent configuration.
It simply runs guessnet against a defined configuration and
then stores the result in a file.
It features:
- Running guessnet against a fixed configuration file and
storing the result in a file
- Copying location-specific files from an
as-it-would-look-like-in-the-real-filesystem filesystem hierarchy
- Running location-specific scrips

USAGE
-----
This script is intended to be run by scripts that put interfaces up,
e.g. /etc/network/if-up.d. For that reason the package already ships
a symlink.

Its however required to create a guessnet.conf, for the tool to work.
See /etc/current-location/guessnet.conf.

FILES
-----
The file can automatically copy files around on a location-change.
For this to work you must have a directory tree under

/etc/current-location/files/<location>

For each file you want to be copied, when this location becomes active,
you put files there with there complete location in the real filesystem, e.g.

/etc/hosts > %P/etc/hosts

(where %P is to be subsituted with /etc/current-location/files/<location>)

SCRIPTS
-------
Its also possible to run scripts once a location becomes active.
These scripts are run *after* the files have been copied around.
Simply create a directory

/etc/current-location/scripts.d/<location>

and put your scripts there. They have to be executable and the
the names must consist entirely of ASCII upper- and lower-case letters,
ASCII digits,  ASCII  underscores,  and  ASCII minus-hyphens.
